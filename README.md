# DNS Violations
List of DNS Violations by implementation, software and/or systems

## About
This _List_ consists of DNS Violation Entries (_DVE_'s) that describes known
violations to the DNS protocol by implementation, software and/or systems.

## Purpose
The purpose of the _List_ is to better understand how wrongfully the DNS
protocol is used out in the wild in order to try and make it better.
There is also a great gain for implementers to verify that they can handle
wrong DNS correctly.

## Violation
An implementation, software and/or system is considered to be in violation
to the DNS protocol when it does not strongly conform to the current DNS
RFCs.  Violations can also include updated or obsolete DNS RFCs.

## Submission
Anyone can submit a DNS violation and request a _DVE_, this is done as a
pull request or an issue.

### Format
**TODO**

## DVE Allocation
_DVE_ are allocated sequentially starting from the number 1 using the format
"DVE-<number>".
**TODO: By whom, how**
