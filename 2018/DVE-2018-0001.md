# DVE-2018-0001: securelogin.arubanetworks.com captive Wi-Fi portals fail to authorise with Ubuntu 17.10+ / systemd-resolved clients

## Description

Ubuntu 17.10+ uses systemd-resolved local caching stub resolver
(127.0.0.53) for system dns resolutions. When trying to connect and
authorise with the captive portal at securelogin.arubanetworks.com, at
some point it fails to resolve correctly and thus users are failing to
pass captive portal authorisation and access internet.

Originally this was reports on Ubuntu bug tracker at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1727237

This might be a bug in Ubuntu/systemd-resolved and/or
securelogin.arubanetworks.com DNS spoofing/captivity and/or both.

From packet capture it appears that DNS query with EDNS0 DO (DNSSEC
OK) bit set to zero, is responded to with NXDOMAIN.

Requests without EDNS0, are responded to with the correct portal IP
address.

Special thanks to Mario Limonciello (https://github.com/superm1) from
Dell Inc for performing necessory packet captures to troubleshoot this
error.

Thanks to Herman Robers from Aruba Networks for identification of
affected Aruba Instant version and
[fixed version AOS-222843](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/Instant_8.x_RN_WebHelp/Content/8.6/17/resolved-issues-86017.htm?Highlight=AOS-222843)

## Proposed fix

Manufacturers of the captive portals should correctly support EDNS0
queries and EDNS0 queries with DO bit zero. If *some* names are handled
or forwarded a special way, servers answering them *must* stay the same
regardless EDNS0 presence or DO bit value.

## Vendor response

Update to [ArubaOS 8.6.17: AOS-222843](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/Instant_8.x_RN_WebHelp/Content/8.6/17/resolved-issues-86017.htm?Highlight=AOS-222843)
or later on the AP providing the captive portal.

## Workaround

Send queries without EDNS0 during connectivity check, until the captive portal
is passed.

In systemd-resolved, when performing lookup of domain names with
'secure' in them, and receiving NXDOMAIN response, retry again without
EDNS0.
